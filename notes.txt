HTML5:

INLINE STYLES
write style element in the tags
ex. <header style="background-color: green"></header>

write in the <head>
ex.
<head>
    <style>
        li{
            background-color: purple;
        }

Separation of concerns - important concept to keep in mind.

.class
#id 
* 
element
element, element
element > element
element + element
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)

what selectors win out in the cascade depends on:
- Specificity
- Importance
- Source Order

* same id can only be used once.

all p that has parent of h2
h2 > p {

element2 element1
i want to select all element1 inside element2
}
BORDER
border: sizepx style color;
